"""The four hand-maintained places the version is written, checked against each other.

Between v0.6.0 and v0.6.2 the tag, ``pyproject.toml`` and ``CITATION.cff`` drifted
three ways and had to be reconciled by hand. This repo has no release job that
writes the version before tagging — the apps do, which is why they do not have the
problem — so the cheap substitute is a test.

**Against each other, not against a tag.** Two of the four are documentation
examples showing a consumer how to pin, and they name the version that is *about
to* be released. Checking them against an existing tag would fail exactly when
someone is preparing a release, which is the one moment this test has to be green.

**Only the hand-maintained places.** Both ``uv.lock`` files record the version too,
but ``uv lock`` writes them. They are derived, not a place anyone edits, and
``uv lock --check`` in the lint jobs already covers them.
