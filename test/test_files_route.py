"""Tests for the ``job_class`` seam on ``serve_files``.

``files_route`` used to import the concrete framework ``Job`` and construct it
inside the routes, which is why both apps kept a near-copy of this module rather
than adopt it. The point of these tests is that the routes work against a job
class the framework has never heard of.
