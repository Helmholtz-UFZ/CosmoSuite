"""Tests for ``cosmo_suite.object_storage_manager`` that need no running store.

The transfer paths need a real S3 server and are covered by the example suite.
What is checked here fails quietly in production instead of loudly in a test:

- presigning must not contact the store, and must sign path-style — the only
  addressing a non-AWS store resolves.
- an expiry beyond seven days signs fine and breaks on download, days later.
- ``setup_remote`` must keep the keys out of process arguments, which every user
  on the host can read.
- ``create_bucket`` used to take a bucket for present when a longer name
  containing it existed.
- under the production log config, botocore wrote ~60 DEBUG records per signed
  URL into the logs table, the signature among them (v0.8.0).
