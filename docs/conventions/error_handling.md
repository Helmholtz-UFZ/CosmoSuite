# Error Handling Conventions

## Central Error Handler

All error handling is centralized in `src/error_handling.py`.

---

## Adding New Errors

**In the framework** — the error is one every consumer can hit:

1. **Define custom exception class** in `error_handling.py`:
   ```python
   class MyCustomError(Exception):
       def __init__(self, some_id):
           self.some_id = some_id
           super().__init__(f"Error with {some_id}")
   ```

2. **Add to `error_responds_dict`** with user-friendly message:
   ```python
   error_responds_dict = {
       MyCustomError: ("Error Title", "User-friendly message about {some_id}"),
       # ...
   }
   ```

3. **Decide on severity** - should error be logged at ERROR level?

**In an app** — the error belongs to one domain: do *not* touch
`error_responds_dict`. Pass the entry as `error_responses`, see the next
section.

---

## An app's own table and its own expected set

```python
def handle_error(
    error,
    *,
    on_unhandled: Callable[[Exception], None] | None = None,
    error_responses: dict[type[Exception], tuple[str, str]] | None = None,
    expected_errors: tuple[type[Exception], ...] | None = None,
) -> None
```

Both are keyword-only and both default to the framework's own values, so
`handle_error(error)` is unchanged. An app wires them the same way it wires
`on_unhandled` — one `partial` in `app.py`, no call site changes:

```python
from functools import partial

from cosmo_suite.error_handling import EXPECTED_ERRORS, USE_ERROR_MESSAGE, handle_error
from soil_moisture_prediction.input_file_parser import FileValidationError

app = Dash(
    ...,
    on_error=partial(
        handle_error,
        on_unhandled=notify_maintainer,
        error_responses={FileValidationError: ("Invalid File", USE_ERROR_MESSAGE)},
        expected_errors=EXPECTED_ERRORS + (SubmittedException, MapTileDownloadError),
    ),
)
```

### `error_responses` **overlays**, `expected_errors` **replaces**

The asymmetry is deliberate.

- The **table** is a lookup, so an overlay is enough: the app names its own
  types and the framework entries it wants reworded, and inherits the database
  and job entries it is happy with. Nothing is lost by not restating them.
- The **expected set** is a policy, and a policy has to be able to shrink. An
  app must be able to take `JobNotFound` *out* — to say "I do want to hear about
  that one" — and an extending argument gives it no way to say so. An app that
  only wants to add writes `EXPECTED_ERRORS + (…)` and says so in one glance.

"Expected" buys an exception the modal and nothing else: no traceback in the
log, no `on_unhandled` call. The framework counts three, COSMOPOLITAN six —
three of them ordinary user states that would otherwise mail the maintainer
every single time they occur.

### `USE_ERROR_MESSAGE` — show `str(error)`

Put the sentinel in the *message* slot when the exception already carries the
sentence the user needs. A parser saying which column of their upload is
malformed is the case it exists for; every other message in the table is a
constant written long before the error happened. The sentinel branch skips
`str.format`, so a message containing braces gets through intact.

### Never mutate `error_responds_dict` from outside

COSMONAUT used to call `error_responds_dict.update(...)` on the framework module
because `handle_error` reads that module attribute on every call. It works
today. It is a workaround for the seam that now exists, and it breaks silently
the moment the framework copies or caches the table, or the app's `import` lands
after the first error — none of which raises anything. It also leaks one app's
entries into anything else in the process.

`error_responses` is the replacement, and it is per call: the module table is
never touched. `test_error_handling.py` pins that.

## Existing Custom Exceptions

- `JobNotFound(job_id)` - Job not in database
- `WrongCeleryTaskId(task_id)` - Invalid Celery task ID
- `JobTableNotConfigured()` - `DbManager.job_table` was never assigned; see
  [database schema](database_schema.md#jobcolumns-the-framework-supplies-columns-the-app-supplies-the-table)

---

## Error Modal

User-facing errors display in modal dialog:
- `ERROR_MODAL_SHARED_ID` - Main modal
- `ERROR_MODAL_TITLE_SHARED_ID` - Title section
- `ERROR_MODAL_MESSAGE_SHARED_ID` - Message body

---

## Integration with Dash

`handle_error()` function integrates with Dash's `on_error`:

```python
# In app.py
app = Dash(..., on_error=handle_error)
```

Flow:
1. Log error at DEBUG level
2. Lay `error_responses` over `error_responds_dict` for this call, and take
   `expected_errors` if one was given
3. Unexpected errors: log traceback, then call `on_unhandled` if one was given
4. Look the title and message up by `type(error)` — an exact-type lookup, not an
   isinstance walk, so a subclass falls back to the generic `Exception` entry
5. Resolve `USE_ERROR_MESSAGE`, or format `{job_id}` into the message
6. Display modal via `set_props()`

---

## Notifying someone: the `on_unhandled` hook

```python
def handle_error(error, *, on_unhandled: Callable[[Exception], None] | None = None, ...) -> None
```

Both apps mail their maintainer when an unexpected error reaches the global
handler. The framework does **not** send that mail. It calls a callable the app
hands it:

```python
# In app.py
from functools import partial
from cosmo_suite.error_handling import handle_error

from my_app.email_service import notify_maintainer

app = Dash(..., on_error=partial(handle_error, on_unhandled=notify_maintainer))
```

Three properties of this seam are deliberate, and each one is load-bearing:

- **`error_handling` never imports an email service.** That would pull mail
  configuration into the framework's dependency set and close an import cycle
  back into the app. The framework calls what it is given and knows nothing
  about it.
- **Keyword-only.** Existing `handle_error(e)` call sites and
  `Dash(on_error=handle_error)` keep working untouched, so the addition is safe
  for a consumer still pinned to an older tag.
- **The hook fires only for unexpected errors** — the same set that gets a full
  traceback logged. `JobNotFound`, `InvalidJobID` and `NotFound` are handled by
  design and must not page anyone. An app that has more such states, or fewer,
  says so with `expected_errors`.

A hook that raises is logged and swallowed. This is a deliberate deviation from
the no-bare-`except` rule (`cosmo_suite/error_handling.py` carries the comment):
an SMTP timeout must not take the user's error modal down with it.

**Why this hook exists at all:** without it, an app that adopts the framework's
`handle_error` switches its maintainer mails off *silently*. No import error, no
failing test, just mails that stop arriving. See
[framework page imports](framework_page_imports.md) for the other members of that
family.

## Exception-name collisions with domain packages

`FileValidationError` is defined by the framework **and** arrives in COSMOPOLITAN
from `soil_moisture_prediction.input_file_parser`. Two classes, one name, in one
process.

**Decision (Slice 2):** the framework keeps defining
`cosmo_suite.error_handling.FileValidationError`. It is in `error_responds_dict`
and the upload callbacks catch it, so it stays where it is. Resolving the
collision is app-side work and belongs in the consuming app's own plan; the app
either catches both classes explicitly, or wraps the foreign exception into the
framework's at the upload boundary where it is raised.

**What the framework cannot do (Slice 3):** match the foreign class in its
table. Two classes sharing a name are not one class with two behaviours — the
framework's entry is not a worse match for the parser's exception, it is no
match at all, and no framework-side edit can change that. That is the concrete
reason `error_responses` exists rather than a longer default table.

**What must not happen:** shadowing one import with the other. The `except`
clause in the upload callback keeps compiling and silently stops matching, so the
validation error escapes to the global handler and the user is shown "Internal
Error" instead of what is wrong with their file.

## Callback Error Patterns

### Inline validation errors
Return error message in callback output:
```python
@callback(...)
def validate_input(value):
    try:
        result = validate(value)
    except ValueError as e:
        return (dash.no_update, str(e), True)  # error message, disable button
    return (result, "", False)
```

### Guard conditions
Use `PreventUpdate` to stop execution:
```python
@callback(...)
def process_action(n_clicks, job_id):
    if n_clicks is None:
        raise PreventUpdate

    if job.status != JOB_STATUS_PENDING:
        log.warning(f"Cannot process - job status is {job.status}")
        raise PreventUpdate
```

### Background task errors
Update status on failure:
```python
try:
    # process
    job.model.status = JOB_STATUS_COMPLETED
except Exception as e:
    log.error(f"Error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    job.model.status = JOB_STATUS_FAILED
    raise
finally:
    job.save()
```
