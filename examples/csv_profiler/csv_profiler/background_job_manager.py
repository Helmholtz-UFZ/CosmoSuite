"""Domain submit wrapper for the CSV profiler computation task.

Thin wrapper over the framework's generic ``submit_job``; mounted on the
framework Job via ``Job.submit_handler`` at startup. Pulling the id out of the
job here is the whole point of the wrapper: the framework's manager takes a bare
``job_id`` and never touches a job object, so an app whose job class keeps the id
somewhere else reaches the same method through its own one-line wrapper.
