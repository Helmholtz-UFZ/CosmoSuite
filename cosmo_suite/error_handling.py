"""Framework response table: exception type -> (modal title, modal message).

**Never mutate this from outside the framework.** An app that needs its own
entries passes them to ``handle_error`` as ``error_responses``; they are laid
over this table for the duration of the call and this dict stays untouched.

Mutating it works today only because ``handle_error`` happens to read the module
attribute on every call. It is a workaround for a missing seam, and it breaks
silently the moment the framework copies the table, caches it, or an app's
``import`` lands after the first error — none of which would raise anything.
The message slot accepts ``USE_ERROR_MESSAGE`` to show ``str(error)``.

            their maintainer from here.

            Keyword-only on purpose: ``handle_error(e)`` and
            ``Dash(on_error=handle_error)`` keep working unchanged, which is
            what makes this addition safe for a consumer still pinned to an
            older tag. An app wires its hook with a partial::

                Dash(..., on_error=partial(handle_error, on_unhandled=notify))

            The framework never imports an email service itself: that would pull
            mail configuration into the framework's dependencies and close an
            import cycle back into the app. It only calls what it is handed.
        error_responses: Entries laid **over** ``error_responds_dict`` for this
            call — the app supplies only its own exception types and the
            framework entries it wants to reword. Overlay rather than
            replacement, so an app never has to restate the database and job
            entries it is happy with.

            It exists because no framework entry can ever match an exception the
            framework cannot import. COSMOPOLITAN's ``FileValidationError``
            comes from ``soil_moisture_prediction.input_file_parser``: a
            different class from ``cosmo_suite.error_handling.FileValidationError``
            that happens to share its name, so the framework's entry is not a
            worse match for it — it is no match at all.

            Use ``USE_ERROR_MESSAGE`` as the message to show ``str(error)``.
        expected_errors: **Replaces** ``EXPECTED_ERRORS`` when given, and does
            not extend it. An app must be able to take an entry *out* as well as
            put one in; the framework's three are a default, not a floor.

            What "expected" buys an exception: the modal, and nothing else — no
            traceback in the log, no ``on_unhandled`` call. COSMOPOLITAN counts
            six, three of them ordinary user states that would otherwise mail
            the maintainer on every single occurrence.

    Both keyword arguments default to the framework's own values, so
    ``handle_error(error)`` behaves exactly as it did in v0.6.2. That is pinned
    by a test: a consumer re-pinning to this version must not be able to notice.
