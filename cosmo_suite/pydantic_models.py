"""Framework pydantic models: job-id validation + the base job-config contract.

The contract comes in two layers:

`BaseJobConfig` is the minimal one — a validated `job_id` and
`validate_assignment=True`. An app whose job table has no upload column
subclasses this and owes the framework nothing else.

`UploadJobConfig` adds `upload_file_name`. That field is not part of the
minimal contract, it belongs to the usage pattern of the framework `Job`, which
persists, reloads, and tracks a single uploaded input file without knowing the
domain. An app adopting `cosmo_suite.job.Job` must therefore subclass
`UploadJobConfig` and inject it via `Job.config_model` at startup.

See docs/plan/cosmo-core-package-boundary.md (config-model contract).
