"""The abstract job contract shared by the framework and its consumer apps.

``BaseJob`` is a *contract*, not an implementation. Construction and storage
differ fundamentally between the apps — one keeps job state in plain attributes,
another behind a Pydantic model — so only the members that framework code
actually calls on a job it did not build are abstract here. Everything else
(working directory, log refresh, domain methods) stays with the concrete class.

Log refresh is deliberately **not** part of the contract: the apps disagree on
its name (``reload_logs`` vs ``get_logs``) and no framework code calls it.

This module imports nothing else from the framework, on purpose: an app must be
able to satisfy the contract without pulling in the framework's database,
object-storage and Pydantic layers.

    class instead of adopting the concrete ``cosmo_suite.job.Job``.
